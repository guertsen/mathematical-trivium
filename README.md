A Mathematical Trivium by V.I. Arnold

Vladimir Igorevich Arnold (often written as V.I. Arnol'd) wrote The Mathematical
Trivium as a reaction to what he saw as declining mathematical standards in
students at Russian universities.

The Trivium consists of 100 questions that he thought would demonstrate true
understanding of concepts essential for mathematicians and physicists.

The article originally appeared in Uspekhi Mat. Nauk 46:1 (1991), 225-232.

An English version of the article, translated by C.J. Shaddock, appeared in
Russian Math. Surveys 46:1 (1991), 271-278.
